# ForgeRock Common REST Demo

This demonstrates use of the ForgeRock
[JSON Resource Servlet](http://commons.forgerock.org/forgerock-rest/json-resource-servlet/) by a browser-based application.

To try the demo:

1.  Deploy the default JSON Resource Servlet in your container
    under `/json`.
2.  Deploy the demo in the same container.
3.  Point your browser at the base of the demo, such as
    `http://localhost:8080/demo`.

The ForgeRock browser-based user interface makes much more interesting use of the REST APIs exposed in ForgeRock products. This demo uses the common REST API in simple ways.
