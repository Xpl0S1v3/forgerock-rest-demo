# ForgeRock Common REST Demo

This demonstrates use of the ForgeRock
[JSON Resource Servlet](http://commons.forgerock.org/forgerock-rest/json-resource-servlet/)
by a browser-based application.

To try the demo:

1.  Clone the workspace locally.
2.  Run the demo with `mvn jetty:run`.
3.  Access the demo at <http://localhost:8080/demo/>.

The ForgeRock browser-based user interface makes much more interesting use of the REST APIs exposed in ForgeRock products. This demo uses the common REST API in simple ways.

## TODO

*   Move to a JavaScript framework such as AngularJS.
*   Style with a well-known framework such as Bootstrap.
*   Provide client-side examples for chapters proposed in
    [CREST-113](https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/CREST-113).
